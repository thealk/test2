## My process {#process}

0. `r emo::ji("pencil2")`
Keep notes in a separate bookdown project. This also helped me cut my teeth on bookdown, and made my notes wayyyyy easier to sift through than previous attempts (Google Docs, actual notebooks, txt files, readmes... I have found a lot of ways to flail)

1. `r emo::ji("spiral_notepad")` 
Get some data in a .csv file

2. `r emo::ji("broom")` 
R file #1: load, tidy, and explore data

3. `r emo::ji("chart_with_upwards_trend")`
R file #2: stats and prep data for use in text, sourcing the work done in R file #1.

4. `r emo::ji("book")`
Rmd file: Write up results! Figures coded in text. Stats reported from final models defined in R file #2, with help from predefined functions and code snippets.
    - This does not have to be a complete chapter. It can be part of a chapter. How modular you want to get is really up to you.

5. `r emo::ji("computer")`
Preview dissertation for myself in an .html format (compiles faster, easier to navigate, and I save it to my Chrome bookmarks for quick access)

6. `r emo::ji("memo")`
Preview multiple .Rmd files in Word to send to my supervisor as .docx
    - `previews/tmp_preview.Rmd` uses `child` files to knit together a subset of my .Rmd files to send to my supervisor
    - There is also a "preview" function with Bookdown, but I haven't been using this (you could though!)

7. `r emo::ji("books")`
When happy, compile the whole dissertation with what I have so far
    - Ensures that I am able to notice and fix any compiling errors at the interim stages and makes me feel like I am making real progress

# RMarkdown crash course {#crashcourse}

*But first: A crash course in RMarkdown*

In Spring 2018 at R-Ladies #LdnOnt we practiced making a [manuscript using RMarkdown](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_london_ontario/tree/master/2018-03-06_rmarkdown) ([slides](http://rpubs.com/thealk/368020)). 
Today we will up the ante and write a whole[^1] dissertation using RMarkdown!

`bookdown` is a brilliant R package designed to incorporate multiple RMarkdown files into a single final product, a book. But `bookdown` is not just for books: 

> Despite the package name containing the word “book”, bookdown is not only for books. The “book” can be anything that consists of multiple R Markdown documents meant to be read in a linear sequence, such as course handouts, study notes, a software manual, a thesis, or even a diary. [From the bookdown preface](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)

[^1]: More like a smidgin than a whole, really.
